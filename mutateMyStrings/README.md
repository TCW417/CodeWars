I will give you two strings. I want you to transform stringOne into stringTwo one letter at a time.

Example:

stringOne = 'bubble gum';
stringTwo = 'turtle ham';

Result:
bubble gum
tubble gum
turble gum
turtle gum
turtle hum
turtle ham

Expected: 
bubble gum\n
tubble gum\n
turble gum\n
turtle gum\n
turtle hum\n
turtle ham\n' 

instead got: 
bubble gum\n
tubble gum\n
tubble gum\n
turble gum\n
turtle gum\n
turtle gum\n
turtle gum\n
turtle gum\n
turtle hum\n
turtle ham\n'
